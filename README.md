# Mindwell
Many people struggle with stress, anxiety or low mood but don’t have easy — or immediate — access to mental-health support. Mindwell aims to lower that barrier, offering 24/7 digital support, mood tracking, and coping tools so that emotional care becomes more accessible, anonymous, and stigma-free.
